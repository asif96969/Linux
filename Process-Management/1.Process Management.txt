1.Process Management
1.1- process
A process is compiled source code that is currently running on the system.
1.2- PID
All processes have a process id or PID.
1.3- PPID
Every process has a parent process (with a PPID). The child process is often started by the
parent process.
1.4- init
The init process always has process ID 1. The init process is started by the kernel itself so
technically it does not have a parent process. init serves as a foster parent for orphaned
processes.
1.5- kill
When a process stops running, the process dies, when you want a process to die, you kill it.
1.6- daemon
Processes that start at system startup and keep running forever are called daemon processes
or daemons. These daemons never die.
1.7- zombie
When a process is killed, but it still shows up on the system, then the process is referred to
as zombie. You cannot kill zombies, because they are already dead.

some command:
#echo $$ $PPID (to check current Process ID and Parent PID)
#ps (To check total Running Process including Background Process)
#Kill -9 14761 (process id ) is called sure kill
#kill -1 1 (command forces the init process)

Some relevant Questions and answer.
----------------------------------
1. Use the jobs command to verify whether you have any processes running in background.
#jobs 
2. Use vi to create a little text file. Suspend vi in background.
#vi text.txt
(inside vi press ctrl-z)
3. Verify with jobs that vi is suspended in background.
[paul@rhel53 ~]$ jobs
[1]+ Stopped vim text.txt
4. Start find / > allfiles.txt 2>/dev/null in foreground. Suspend it in background before it
finishes.
[paul@rhel53 ~]$ find / > allfiles.txt 2>/dev/null
 (press ctrl-z)
[2]+ Stopped find / > allfiles.txt 2> /dev/null
5. Start two long sleep processes in background.
sleep 4000 & ; sleep 5000 &
sleep 4000 & ( for single long sleep )
6. Display all jobs in background.
[paul@rhel53 ~]$ jobs
[1]- Stopped vim text.txt
[2]+ Stopped find / > allfiles.txt 2> /dev/null
[3] Running sleep 4000 &
[4] Running sleep 5000 &
7. Use the kill command to suspend the last sleep process.
[paul@rhel53 ~]$ kill -SIGSTOP 4532
